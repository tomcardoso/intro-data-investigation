					<p>First: A primer on prisons<br />(though I’m guessing you all know this already)</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>A sentence of <strong>two years or longer</strong> lands you in federal prison.</li>
						<li>Roughly 12,000 to 14,000 people in custody each year.</li>
						<li>Most prisoners don’t serve until their sentence is up — instead, they get paroled or stat released</li>
						<li>Various institutions across the country for men and women. They’re divided into minimum-, medium- and maximum-security facilities.</li>
						<li>We have a <strong>massive</strong> overincarceration problem for Indigenous and Black people.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Why did we focus on risk scores?</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Within prison, <strong>risk assessments</strong> are a constant. Prisoner are repeatedly assessed and reassessed, and their life inside depends in large part on how they score</li>
						<li>In essence, these tools are designed to measure an person’s risk to the public and their odds of rehabilitation</li>
						<li>Work, housing, treatment programs, privileges, parole – scores affect it all</li>
						<li>As a federal judge put it in 2015, risk scores are “like a branding – hard to overcome”</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section class="pull-left">
					<p>While CSC’s tools don’t explicitly ask about a person’s race, they can certainly capture it by asking questions about family structure, substance use, levels of education, where a person grew up, etc.</p>
					<p>In fact, race has previously been a <strong>direct component</strong> of risk assessments.</p>
					<p>In 1928, Ernest Burgess, a Canadian-born University of Chicago sociologist, built a now-famous tool for the Illinois Board of Paroles that predicted a person’s odds of reoffending. One of the 22 variables used was the <strong>race of the prisoner’s father.</strong></p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>So: What are the Correctional Service of Canada’s risk assessments like?</h3>
				</section>

				<section class="pull-left">
					<p>CSC uses two separate risk scoring approaches:</p>
					<p><strong>Actuarial tools</strong>, which require officers to fill out a questionnaire and tally up the resulting score</p>
					<p><strong>Structured professional judgment tools</strong>, which rely on an officer’s experience and opinion</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Though there are many risk tools and types of scores in federal prison, two are most important: <strong>security classification</strong> and the <strong>reintegration potential score</strong>.</p>

				<section>
					<p>But…</p>
					<p><span class="highlight-burgundy"><strong>But: Evaluating risk is tricky. Tons of room for bias.</strong></span></p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Highly subjective to the assessor (low rater reliability)</li>
						<li>Results are tough to interpret. What does it mean to have a “medium” security risk?</li>
						<li>Experts disagree over how risk scores should be developed and administered</li>
						<li>Current federal risk tools are <strong>old</strong>. Over time, they become less effective</li>
						<li>Most were built off a sample of mostly white, male prisoners from the 1980s</li>
						<li><span class="highlight-burgundy">Culturally biased</span></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section class="pull-left">
					<p>Another major problem with risk scores is that they often rely on criminal history, which becomes a proxy for race. As Prof. Bernard Harcourt at Columbia University put it to me:</p>
					<p><em>“You’re not predicting the actual essence of the person and their dangerousness – you’re predicting how likely it is that, because of policing disparities, they would get arrested again. … You’re not predicting crime. You’re predicting policing.”</em></p>
					<p>In other words, being Black or Indigenous becomes a risk factor in itself.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What we found</h3>
					<p><em>After controlling for variables like age, gender, the severity of people’s offences and past contact with the criminal justice system…</em></p>
					<p>Black men are roughly <span class="highlight-burgundy"><strong>24%</strong></span> more likely than white men to end up in maximum security at admission.</p>
					<p>Indigenous men are roughly <span class="highlight-burgundy"><strong>30%</strong></span> more likely to have the worst reintegration score at any point.</p>
					<p>Both are <span class="highlight-burgundy"><strong>less likely</strong></span> to reoffend after controlling for reintegration scores.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Even worse for Indigenous women</h3>
					<p>They’re roughly <span class="highlight-burgundy"><strong>64%</strong></span> more likely than white women to end up in maximum security at admission.</p>
					<p>Also roughly <span class="highlight-burgundy"><strong>40%</strong></span> more likely to receive the worst reintegration score.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>And, as an internal report we obtained made clear: The government had warned the Correctional Service <strong>in 2004</strong> of serious bias in its risk scores.</p>
					<p>To this day, the risk tools used to produce those scores remain unchanged.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Response and feedback</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>First story published on a Saturday. By Monday, the House of Commons’ public safety committee had announced a study of systemic racism in prison risk assessments with all-party support</li>
						<li>Prime Minister acknowledged findings a few days later</li>
						<li>Lawyers have used our reporting at parole hearings</li>
						<li>Class-action lawsuit filed against the government on behalf of tens of thousands of prisoners</em></li>
						<li>Series has won journalism awards both in Canada and abroad</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What surprised us about what we uncovered?</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>The (quantifiable!) impact of race on people’s scores was very large</li>
						<li>In fact, it was so large we were initially convinced we’d made a grave methodological error</li>
						<li>Furthermore, the Correctional Service had been aware of these issues, both through a Public Safety Canada report and numerous reports from other agencies and experts, for almost two decades — but did nothing</li>
						<li>Even parole officers we spoke with had concerns about these tools, and they use them every day!</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Where does the government (and academia) go from here?</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Given the current class-action suit, it seems unlikely CSC will voluntarily pull its risk tools any time soon</li>
						<li>The series seems to have kicked off a conversation in some places about what a better custodial risk assessment might look like</li>
						<li>(Do we even need one at all?)</li>
						<li>It’s worth asking: What would a culturally-appropriate risk tool look like?</li>
						<li>How can we mitigate and counteract the avalanche of biases faced by racialized prisoners?</li>
					</ul>
