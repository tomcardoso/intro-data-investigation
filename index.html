				<section>
					<h3>Why use data?</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Data can strengthen your story.</p>
					<p>Unlike most storytelling techniques, data allows you to make non-anecdotal conclusions. Put simply, a strong data-driven finding can <strong>give you your nut graf</strong>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>But don’t assume your data is the truth! Data can be just as deceptive and malleable as anecdotal evidence – especially if not used carefully.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>A technical example: Anscombe’s quartet</p>
					<img src="img/anscombe.png" alt="Anscombe’s quartet, visualized" style="height: 60vh">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>The datasets used to generate all four charts have the same descriptive statistics: mean, standard deviation and correlation. Yet the datasets are clearly different!</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>A real-world example: Early coverage of mortality rates for COVID-19 infections.</p>
					<p>Back in May, 2020, some focused on the fact that COVID-19 had killed fewer people than the flu.</p>
					<p>This was <strong>technically true</strong> in absolute terms – early in the pandemic, an average flu year killed more people than COVID-19 had by that point. But the mortality rate for those who’d contracted COVID-19 was far greater than for the flu, meaning the disease is <strong>much deadlier</strong>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>A lesson when using data, then: Even the strongest-looking statistics may hide assumptions and slanted interpretations. Be careful!</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Acquiring data</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Much of your work will be in sourcing data, and then cleaning it once you’ve obtained it. There are many ways to get the info you need:</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>File a data-oriented freedom of information request. (Check out <a href="https://github.com/tomcardoso/foi-data-journalism">my talk on this here</a>.)</li>
						<li>Use a public resource like Statistics Canada. A caveat: Their data are highly summarized and aggregated, meaning they’re less useful for detailed exploration.</li>
						<li>Email someone – the government, an academic, etc. – and politely ask for the data you need. You’d be surprised how often this works.</li>
						<li>Scrape it! (I’ve got a <a href="https://github.com/tomcardoso/intro-to-scraping">half-day course on this here</a>.)</li>
						<li>Use an open data portal. (I rarely, if ever use these.)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Ultimately, though, the best way to find the data you need is to <strong>pick up the phone</strong>.</p>
					<p>Let people guide you and point you towards what kind of data you should look at for your story, where you can find it, etc.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Analysis</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Before you can really start analyzing, odds are you’ll need to clean your data in some way. Roughly 80 per cent of the total time I spend with a dataset is dedicated to cleaning up variable names, standardizing values as needed, etc.</p>
					<p>Cleaning tasks will be different for each project, so you won’t know what you need to do until you see the file(s).</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>When analyzing your data – be it in Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau or a more advanced tool like R or Python – you should <strong>let the data guide you.</strong></p>
					<p>Try not to make any assumptions or go in expecting certain outcomes.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Instead, build up your analysis step by step.</p>
					<p>Start with simple descriptive statistics: averages, medians, etc. From there, move on to doing those operations in groups (in Excel, you’d do this in Pivot Tables, but it becomes <strong>far easier</strong> in R or Python.)</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Once you’ve built up a feel for the data, you’ll know enough to begin “interviewing” it.</p>
					<p>Ask questions. For instance, if you were working on a story about emergency response times, you might ask:</p>
					<p>How often are paramedics being called to a particular postal code? How long do they take to respond to that postal code compared to their average response time? Where are they fastest? Where are they slowest?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>As you arrive at conclusions, and especially if they’re surprising or revelatory, you should try to <strong>actively disprove your findings</strong>. Attack the same problem from the opposite perspective: Is there any way you could’ve misinterpreted the data?</p>
					<p>This process will force you to shore up your analysis and identify any gaps in the findings.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Finally, <strong>document your analysis process</strong>. What steps did you take to arrive at your findings?</p>
					<p>Consider writing a methodology story to accompany your main piece.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Visualization</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Visualization is essential – both during analysis, and when presenting your final product.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>During analysis, you should <strong>always</strong> be visualizing. Try to chart constantly: Your visuals will reveal hidden patterns and point at new ways to interrogate your data.</p>
					<p>For instance…</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<video width="auto" height="100%" autoplay muted>
					  <source src="img/dino.mov" type="video/mp4">
						Your browser does not support the video tag.
					</video>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>A quick glance reveals little about what the data shows. In fact, it looks fairly random. But…</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="img/anscombesaurus.png" alt="An image representation of a dataset that draws a dinosaur">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Once you have your data collected and analysis done, it’s time to visualize. There are many tools you can use here:</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/">Datawrapper</a> (the best tool for the general public, hands down)</li>
						<li><a href="https://flourish.studio/">Flourish</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://rawgraphs.io/">RAW Graphs</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a></li>
						<li>Making it yourself using Adobe Illustrator, R, Python, etc.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Levelling up: R</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>There are inherent limits to what Excel can do. At a certain point, your analysis will require so many steps or take so long that it’s no longer a good idea to work in Excel, Google Sheets or Tableau.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>At that point, you should consider learning a programming language. My strong advice here (and personal preference) is <strong>R, a statistical programming language</strong> that is surprisingly easy to pick up.</p>
					<p>With R, you can:</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Run a complex, multi-stage analysis on gigabytes of data with millions of rows.</li>
						<li>Easily perform tasks that are difficult when using simple spreadsheets, like joins or string manipulation.</li>
						<li>Codify your data cleaning pipeline for a given project, which allows you to focus on analysis.</li>
						<li>Easily create visualizations as you work.</li>
						<li>Write scrapers to automate data collection.</li>
						<li>Eventually apply advanced techniques, like statistical modelling and machine learning.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>“Great! How do I learn R?”</p>
					<p>The best introductory resource is <strong><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a></strong>.</p>
